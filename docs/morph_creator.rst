Morph Creator
=============

The new Morph Creator allows users and devlopers alike to create and edit morphs.

This is a development tool, which of it's kind has never been present in MB-Lab, making it a unique addition to the addon.

This document is a WIP.

Typical workflow

* Create a base model.
* Save it by "Store base body vertices" button.
* Create a morph for min values. (and maybe save steps)
* Press save work-in-progress button.
* Save the file.
* Reset the model.
* Create the morph for max values.
* Press save work-in-progress button.
* Save it in the same file.
* Exit Blender
* Open Blender, re-create the same model if morph was made for a specific body, of same gender otherwise.
* Check Body measures, and the part where the morphs is stored.


**IMPORTANT**

.. warning::
    Do not edit the index/name/number of vertices. NEVER!
    You just can change their location!
