* Muscle System fixed

.. image:: images/muscle_code_01.png

There were some serious bugs related to the Muscle system of MB-Lab that had gone unnoticed for some time
These have been fixed with this version.

* Proxy Engine update

The Proxy engine has been improved. Fixed fitting of meshes that are very close to the skin. New option to fit in reverse direction to convert a character-specific mesh to a generic proxy.

* GUI updated

With the new features added the GUI started to get a little crowded, this version has been updated slightly to shrink it down

* Skin tone for each model type of realistic humans

Now skin tones by default will load per model type

* MB-Lab Skin 2

This is a completely new skin shader, using more procedural elements than previous versions, eliminating a lot of texture maps for simple rendering functions (Specular, SSS, Roughness etc...)

* Nail shader

This is a new shader for finger and toe nails with the option to mix between "natural" and "painted".


=============
Version 1.7.5
=============

This version is meant to be the "official" stable version for Blender 2.80 after it is officially released.

* GUI change

This version shows the evolution of the GUI that has changed since the original 1.6.1 version.

Icons have been added everywhere now!

* Improved Eye and Iris Shaders

This was a very late addition to MB-Lab 1.7.5 but looks fantastic compared to the previous versions

.. image:: images/new_eyes_04.png

* Animation BVH Files

These are "raw" BVH files of some basic animations such as walking, running, jumping etc...

* BVH Bone Config

Save and load config files to adjust bones after importing BVH animation files.

=============
Version 1.7.4
=============

Shaders for this version have been re-worked from the ground up to try to achieve a realistic look as much as possible.

The skin shader has dropped the Principled BSDF node in favor of a new custom node network.

Procedural veins have been added. The visibility of the veins are controlled by a slider in the skin editor.

The eyes have become completely procedural in this version, which allows a greater range of color for the iris than before.

Eye vein visiblity is controlled with a slider.

The lighting setup has been changed to a three point arrangment using Area lights now.


=============
Version 1.7.3
=============

This version is the addition of the Auto Updater.

.. image:: images/auto_updater_173.png

This will allow users to update to new versions of MB-Lab without having to go to Github or reclone manually.

The updater can auto check at a user defined set interval.

The updater also can make backups of MB-Lab so if by chance a buggy version is released, this can revert back to working version.

The only downside is that the updater works from version 1.7.3 onward so it is not possible to revert back to previous versions, so this makes it a pretty important update as well.
